# MyMentor
Mobile application project originally designed for my CSC 4330 course. MyMentor fosters professional, yet personal relationships between 
students and teachers. These relationships will help students throughout their college journey and beyond by allowing them to easily communicate with peers and professors so that they have access to all of the support they need to succeed at their University. MyMentor 
provides a platform that teachers can use to help mentor students in both their inter- and extra-curriculum needs.

MyMentor consists of:
- Xamarin solution
  - Xamarin core project
  - Xamarin Android
  - Xamarin iOS
- .NET back-end solution
  - API
  - DataServices
  
Both of these solutions can be loaded and executed in Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE. Note that the `Xamarin` and `DataServices` solutions must be opened in separate Visual Studio windows. They must be run independently of each other in order to utilize all features of MyMentor (i.e. login, mentor matching, instant messaging).
